<!-- ABOUT -->
### NomNom

NomNom is a web application built with React and Java (Spring) for our group capstone project of the 16-week CodeClan Professional Software Development course. This app's aim is to engage young children in the joys of cooking with the help of a parent or guardian, while teaching children the basics of food preparation and nutrition. It allows the user to log in to save their favourite recipes, review recipes, and rate them. It was created in February/March 2023 by Delphine Dallison, Brian Dickson, Anne McGinness, and Jill Atkins.
